# NewFTP
### General
A GUI program to login the FTP system and a background program to manage FTP file downloading.
It's open source, unlike any other distribution in TG.
Feel free to edit its looking.
### Controlling
#### Touch control
- tap the square block to login
- slide up and down to turn the pages
- slide towards left to minimize
- tap the minimized floating window to maximize
- drag the minimized window to put it any where
- right click to quit
#### Remote control
- press F3 to start (depend on the hotkey you set)
- press the number corresponding to the block to login
- PgUp and PgDown to turn the pages
- press F3 again to gain focus or show window
- Enter to maximize
- left arrow to minimize (have not done yet)
- press Esc, namely Back to quit
#### Keyboard and mouse
- I think you know it 

### Why minimized floating window
As you know, python is a language for the 21st century,
and easy to write, read and mantain. However, it takes ages to start.
To cut down the waiting time, the minimized window is the best option.
### Why pywin32
The smoother, the more win32API should be used. (please do not complain my abusing win32API)
### TO DO
#### Black Magic
Dragging out the files newly uploaded from main window to the desktop. (this might be quite hard)
#### Good-looking Themes
It is obvious that we are using Microsoft Windows7 theme. What if Linux theme or other awesome software, organizations?
#### Advertising
Good things should be shared.
